                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The first American women to go to Space</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="imagens/sally_ride.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <p>Born on May 26th of 1951 in Los Angeles city, Sally Kristen Ride grew up in a healthy family, where her parents and her sister, Karen, always supported her. From a youthful age, she showed her interest in mathematics and science. In an interview to the USA press in 1983, Sally’s parents affirmed that “we just let her grow normally.”
                                        Besides being a bright child, Ride was very athletic. With that, she received a scholarship to play tennis in Westlake School for Girls. Her path to become a professional athlete seemed to be certain, but everything changed when she got her bachelor's degree in physics and english, a master’s degree in physics and a doctor’s degree in astrophysics at Stanford's University. 
                                         Ride decided to ignore the stereotypes that science was not meant for girls and ventured in a new way to form a career at NASA. After being selected by the agency in January of 1978, she went through a very intense training to be incorporated in new missions, being announced as one of the specialists who would embark on the spaceship Challenger in 1982
                                        Sally Rider was not the first women to go to space, once the URSS had already done that twice. Although, she would be the first north American to do that. The pressure was so much that the local press started to confront her with a series of questionable and undue questions. 
                                        According to what was published at the time, Ride was questioned about how she would deal with her period in space, if she would wear makeup or a bra during the travel or if she was afraid that the spacial flight would compromise her capacity to have kids. “It’s a shame that this is so important. It’s a shame that our society is no longer advanced” she said, immediately. 
                                        If society was not ready to see a woman in that position, Sally was. On July 18th of 1983, she boarded the Challenger and spend six days in space, implanting two satellites. Even if her mission seemed uneventful, the fact that Sally was the one doing it was historic and will always be remembered. 
                                        The astronaut died on June 23rd of 2012, at age 61, due to a pancreatic cancer. Before that, she spends her last year of life incentivizing more girls to study science and mathematics, leaving a huge legacy behind.

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="imagens/R (1).jfif" alt="..." />
                                    <p>Marie Sklodowska Curie was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland. 
                                        Her father was a teacher of Mathematics and Physics, and her mother was also 
                                        a teacher, but unfortunately Marie became an orphan of her mother between 
                                        the ages of 10 or 11.
                                        Marie was always interested in knowledge, and encouraged by her family, she 
                                        decided to pursue a career.
                                        At the time Poland was dominated by Tsarist Russia, in which women were 
                                        forbidden to study. 
                                        In 1891, with her father’s 
                                        financial assistance, she 
                                        entered the faculty of 
                                        science for a degree in 
                                        physics, which she 
                                        completed in 1893. 
                                        In search of a supervisor for 
                                        her doctorate, Marie met 
                                        physics professor Pierre 
                                        Curie, married in 1895 and 
                                        had two daughters, Éve and 
                                        Irène. 
                                        In her doctoral thesis, Marie 
                                        Curie chose the subject of 
                                        uranium rays, radiation that 
                                        had been discovered by the 
                                        English physicist Becquerel. 
                                        Marie ended up discovering 
                                        that uranium oxide is a 
                                        mineral capable of 
                                        eliminating the radiation found in atoms. 
                                        From her studies, Marie discovered radioactivity. 
                                        In 1898, Marie and Pierre present to the world the discovery of two new 
                                        chemical elements, polonium and radium. With this information, Pierre realized 
                                        that he could kill cells from diseased tissues, thus starting the study of 
                                        radiotherapy. 
                                        Marie Currie was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize twice, once in 
                                        Physics, for discovering the existence of natural radioactivity in 1903, and the 
                                        other in Chemistry, for the discovery of two new chemical elements in 1910. 
                                        After Pierre’s death in 1906, Marie continued to carry out various research and 
                                        took up a post teaching general physics at the prestigious Sorbonne university,</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The first programmer of the history</p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="imagens/R.jfif" alt="..." />
                                    <p>Augusta Ada Byron King, was a brilliant woman, mother, mathematician and writer. After her death she became known as the enchanter of numbers, mother of software and creator of the first computer program of the history.

                                        Bor in december 10 of 1815 in Byron, London. Was the only child of Anne Isabella Byron, matematician of a high family and baroness of Wentworth, and Lord Byron. But before Ada complete 2 months of life, their parents broke up and her dad leaves england four months after. She has only see one portrait oh her dad when was twenty years old. At this same age she get married to William Lord King, that was nominated earl of Lovelace in 1838, and became countess of lovelace.
                                        
                                        Anne kept the daughter busy with her studies in music and math. And, even though she looks like a good mother, we know that their relationship wasnt that better.
                                        
                                        In math...
                                        
                                        Her "most interesting" history begins when, with seventeen years old, she met Mary Sommerville, also a english matematician and cientist who traduced and collaborated with the works of laplace and was the first woman to join the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) with Caroline Hershel. Mary would became her friend and mentor.
                                        
                                        At one of the dinners in which Ada participates, invited by Mary, she meets Charles Babbage (mathematician creator of the Differential and Analytical Machines) and during dinner, Babbage comments on his new project: the differential machine whose objective was to perform calculations of polynomials of mechanical way (remembering that at that time, there was still no electricity), and Ada is very enthusiastic about the subject. In addition, when visiting British industrial parks, Ada became interested in the Jacquard mechanical loom, a machine that used punched cards to command the creation of patterns on the fabrics produced. But at first, there is no partnership between the two.
                                        
                                        After getting married and giving birth to her daughter, Ada get sick,  with very fragile health, and returns to studying mathematics under the tutoring of mathematician Augustus de Morgan, a pioneer in the field of symbolic logic.
                                        
                                        Ada also reconnects with Babbage, and learns that his new idea, the Analytical Engine, which after the development of the differential engine, promised to develop a variety of complex operations, but while Babbage was thinking in numbers, Ada saw a potential for processing as well. symbols, including musical and artistic notations.
                                        
                                        The analytical engine could only be built after Charles's death, and could not get off the drawing board before for political, financial, etc. reasons. Although the machine was not built during Charles's lifetime, in 1985 a professor at the University of Sydney, Allan G. Bromley, studied Babbage's design with the support of Doron Swade, curator of The London Science Museum, they were able to build it in a period of 17 years. The machine had the same structure as current computers, with input, processing and data output devices.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">The First Woman to Go to Space </p>
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="imagens/R (2).jfif" alt="..." />
                                    <p>Valentina was born on May 6th, 1937, in Bolshoye Maslennikovo, in north Moscou. Her parents always worked hard. Her father was a tractor driver, and her mother worked in a textile factory. During the war of Russia and Finland, in 1940, her father disappeared, and sadly, she lost her father. 
                                        As a teenager, she dropped out of school and started working to help her mother with household expenses. Still young, Valentina got interested in skydiving and joined a training school. There, she learned and fell in love with it, and made innumerous jumps.
                                        She lived in the context of the Cold War, where one of the strongest characteristics of this conflict was the Space Race. One of the goals of this race, was to take the first woman into space. 
                                        Russia has chosen Valentina to do this, thanks to her capacity and ability in skydiving, and because she was a member of Komsomol, a communist party wing. Besides, she also fitted in the woman pattern the Soviet Union considered ideal. 
                                        Seven months of serious training passed until she was ready to, at the age of 26, go on her only space trip. And just like that, on June 16th of 1963, Tereshkova boarded the Vostok 6 and goes into the unknown. She spent 71 hours (about 3 days) in space and completed 48 turns around the sun. Valentina said that during her travel she felt nausea and pain, in addition to the worsening of her mental health. 
                                        Her return to Planet Earth was complicated. She almost needed to land on a lake, but happily due to the wind, she managed to land safely in dry land. Once she returned, she was welcomed as a heroin. And a statue in her honor was placed on the spot where she landed. 
                                        Valentina decided to leave the spacial program in 1969, after graduating in engineering by the Militar Academy of the Air Force of Zhukovsky and dedicate herself to politics. Nowadays, she is a member of the party of the president Vladimir Putin, the United Russia.
